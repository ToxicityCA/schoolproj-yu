<p> <center> About Me |  <a href="games.html" target="_self">Games</a>  | <a href="anime.html" target="_self">Anime</a>  </p> </center>

<center> <h1 id=title>Hey there, My name is Prasanna Vinotheeswaran!</h1> </center>

<p>I'm a 19-year-old student, who goes to York University! </p>
<h5>You probably already knew that though, didn't you...</h5>

<p> I'm a big fan of all kinds of Video Games, Anime, and More! This website is meant to serve as an autobiography of sort, to showcase and allow me to talk about whatever i wish to! </p>


<center> <h3> HERE COMES THE FUN FACTS!!!</h3> </center>

<p>Did you know that my favourite animal in the <font size=3>world </font><font size=4>is </font><font size=5>the </font><font size=6>giraffe?</font></p>

<p> <i>I've played the drums for about 10 years, and i've also played the piano for over 13 years!</i> </p>

<p> I actually collect merchandice from a japanese superhero show, called <b> Kamen Rider!</b>

<p> <i> I play trading card games! The most popular one i play is Pok√©mon, and my favourite one, is called "Cardfight! Vanguard". </i> </p>
<hr>


<p> Now, you might be wondering why there is a list of directory links at the top of the screen. <h1> But... wwwwwwhyyyyyy???</h1>

<h5>Put simply, I suck at formatting.</h5><p>Ironic, considering that this entire language is based in formatting, huh? :) </p>

<p>To make my train of thought simpler, I have decided to organize the sections of this website, into individual pages, sorted above.</p>


<tt> Below is all experimental stuff, up until the end of the body. Also, this is for testing out the typewriter=style text </tt>

<p> Write about my favourite command, and use the (openbracket) code (closebracket) cmd to show how it works<img src= 'images\collageimg.png' align=right></p>


<p> Fun Fact! I went to 4 different schools in the span of 2 years!</p>








 <table>
 <tr vallign=center>
  <tr>
   <td allign=center>
    <td>While i was in Middle School, I went to <a href='https://www.tdsb.on.ca/Find-your/Schools/schno/3015'>Amesbury Middle School.</a></td>
    <td>Then, I chose to go to <a href='https://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/yorkmemorial'>York Memorial Collegiate Institute.</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td allign=center>
    <td><img src= 'images\AMESBURYMIDDLESCHOOL.jpg'></td>
    <td><img src= 'images\YORKMEMOCOLLEGIATEINSTITUTE.jpg'></td>
  </tr>
</table> 

<p>Unfortunately, The school <a href='https://www.cp24.com/news/officials-say-damage-at-york-memorial-ci-is-extensive-but-structure-is-salvageable-1.4413137'>caught on fire</a> on May 7th, 2019, and we were forced to move to another school nearby, called <a href='https://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/georgeharvey'>George Harvey Collegiate Institute</a>, for the rest of the year.<img src= 'images\GEORGEHARVEYCOLLEGIATEINSTITUTE.JPG' align=right></p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>This wasn't a permenent solution, and at the start of the next year, the Toronto District School board moved the populace of York Memo, to a school somewhat nearby, which hadn't been in use for a while. This school's name was called <a href='https://www.scarlettheights.ca/'>Scarlett Heights Entrepreneurial Academy</a>. This is where I remained until the end of my High school years.<img src= 'images\SCARLETTHEIGHTS.JPG' align=left></p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p> At the end of my High School, I chose to take a Gap year in order to work a job and earn some extra money to put towards university. That job was at Pizza Pizza! </p>

<p> And at the end of that gap year, I finally enrolled in York University. Unfortunately, The CUPE strike effected the school in the first year as well, shutting down a bunch of courses across the whole campus. </p>
<h4> <i> I seem to have really bad luck with the events that happen at my school's first years, huh... </i> </h4>
