<Center><h6>Ok, Who doesn't play at least some kind of video game nowadays...</h6></center>



<p style=background-color:#d6d6d6>I play a bunch of video games! I've decided to list a selection of them in this webpage, because they are a big part of my hobbys!</p>


<p id="HSR"> <img src= 'images/HONKAISTARRAIL.gif' align=left> <b>Honkai Star Rail</b>: This is a Japanese-styled RPG Game, where you collect characters and weapons, and slowly upgrade them with materials collected from the worlds you travel. The story of this game is very high quality, and even though the game looks extremly high quality, the game can even run on mobile devices! The gif on the right shows an example of the gameplay of Honkai: Star Rail. </p>

<b> osu!</b>: This is a music-based Rhythm game, where you move your mouse to notes on the screen, and click them successively, in time with the beat of the song. This is not a well known game, and is only available on PC as of right now, but it's community is thriving, and I believe that it's a very fun game to play!</p>

<b> Beat Saber</b>: This is another music-based Rhythm game, but the main difference between this and "osu!" is that Beat saber can only be played... in VR! I own an Oculus Quest 2, which is a standalone VR headset, and that allows me to play most VR games, such as Beat Saber. This is a game that times floating blocks moving towards you. These blocks have arrows on them, and you need to slice the blocks into pieces, using one of 2 sabers in your hands. This is another really fun game that I play in my part time.</p>
